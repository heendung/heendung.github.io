I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/) (CSE) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) (OSU), advised by [Wei-Lun Harry Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/). I am broadly interested in machine learning and its applications to Vision-and-Language. Recently, I have focused on Multimodal Foundation Models, Generative AI, Web Navigation, Embodied AI, Visual Question Answering, and Scene-Text Understanding. <br>

ðŸ”¥ **I am on the job market in 2024. Please reach out to me (kil.5@osu.edu) if you are interested in my research.** ðŸ”¥<br><br>
