I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/) (CSE) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) (OSU), advised by [Wei-Lun Harry Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/). I am broadly interested in machine learning and its applications to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. <br><br>
