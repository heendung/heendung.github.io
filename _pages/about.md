I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), advised by [Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/). \
I am interested in machine learning and its applications to **Vision-Language**. Recently, I have focused on the following topics:
* Multimodal Foundation Models
* Multimodal Agents (Web Agents, Embodied AI)
* Visual Question Answering, Scene-Text Understanding
* Few/Zero-Shot Learning <br>

ðŸ”¥ **I am on the job market in 2024. Please contact me if you are interested in my research.** ðŸ”¥<br><br>
