I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/) (CSE) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) (OSU), advised by [Wei-Lun Harry Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/). I am broadly interested in machine learning and its applications to Vision-Language. Recently, I have focused on the following topics:
* Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)
* Web Navigation, Embodied AI
* Visual Question Answering, Scene-Text Understanding
* Zero-Shot Learning <br>

ðŸ”¥ **I am on the job market in 2024. Please reach out to me (kil.5@osu.edu) if you are interested in my research.** ðŸ”¥<br><br>
