I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://research.adobe.com/">Adobe Research</a>. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University, advised by [Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/). My research interests include AI agents, with a recent focus on **computer-use** and **GUI agents**. I am also interested in **multimodal understanding** and **generation** for long-form content such as documents or textbooks. Feel free to contact me at [jkil@adobe.com](mailto:jkil@adobe.com) for university collaborations and internships.
